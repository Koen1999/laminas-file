As such, it should be used in conjunction with a DirectoryIterator or RecursiveDirectoryIterator . Use cases include building class maps for autoloading. Usage The ClassFileLocator constructor can take one of: a string representing a directory location; if valid, this will be used to seed a RecursiveDirectoryIterator instance. a DirectoryIterator instance. a RecursiveDirectoryIterator instance. In each case, once constructed, iteration will result in a list of files containing PHP clases, interfaces, abstracts, or traits. Instead of returning standard SplFileInfo instances, the ClassFileLocator is configured to cast to Laminas\\File\\PhpClassFile instances, which extend SplFileInfo , and provide the following additional methods: getClasses() : returns an array of all classes, abstract classes, interfaces, and traits defined in the file; all names are fully qualified. getNamespaces() : returns an array of namespaces defined in the file. Tokenization The ClassFileLocator uses the tokenizer extension in order to locate items of interest; as such, its operations will not execute PHP files it finds. Example The following will spit out a PHP file that returns a class map for the src/ directory in which it is run: <?php use Laminas\\File\\ClassFileLocator; $path = realpath(getcwd() . '/src'); $locator = new ClassFileLocator($path); $map = []; foreach ($locator as $file) { $filename = str_replace($path . '/', '', $file->getRealPath()); foreach ($file->getClasses() as $class) { $map[$class] = $filename; } } printf(\"<?php\\nreturn %s;\", var_export($map, true));","title":"ClassFileLocator"},{"location":"class-file-locator/#classfilelocator","text":"Laminas\\File\\ClassFileLocator is a PHP FilterIterator for use with locating files containing PHP classes, interfaces, abstracts, or traits.
